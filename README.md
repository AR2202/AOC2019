# AOC2019

Beginner-Level Haskell (and some Rust) solutions to the Advent of Code 2019 challenges.

The challenge can be found here: https://adventofcode.com/2019.

Every user receives their individual puzzle input. My inputs are provided in a folder called 'inputs'.

The project was created with Stack (and Cargo for Rust).

To try out these solutions, load into stack ghci. 

Please note: these are solutions that produce the correct answers. They are probably not very idiomatic and definitely not optimized for performance.
